I'll fetch the repository to understand its structure and create a comprehensive to-do list for it.

Perfect! Now I'll create a comprehensive doubled to-do list for the Electrician repository.

Now let me present this to you:

I've created a comprehensive doubled to-do list for your Electrician repository with **50 major categories and 350+ subtasks**! 

**Key sections include:**

1. **Core Features** - Complete & optimize existing calculators (Ohm's Law, Voltage Drop, etc.)
2. **New Calculators** - Three-phase power, wire ampacity, conduit fill, motor FLC, circuit breaker sizing
3. **Code Quality** - TypeScript migration, proper state management, component library
4. **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, E2E testing, performance testing
5. **UI/UX** - Dark mode, accessibility, design system, animations
6. **Navigation & Routing** - React Navigation setup, screen organization
7. **Data & Storage** - Local storage, offline functionality, reference data
8. **Platform Support** - Android, iOS, Web builds and CI/CD pipeline
9. **Documentation** - Code docs, user guides, API reference, developer guides
10. **Deployment** - App store submission, versioning, release management
11. **Analytics & Monitoring** - Error tracking, user feedback, metrics
12. **Growth & Maintenance** - Community building, marketing, ongoing updates

The list includes priority tiers, success metrics, and an implementation strategy with estimated timeline (6-12 months for full completion).
