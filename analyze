Analyzing Ladder Logic Standards

I'm initially focusing on the IEC 61131-3 standard, specifically for ladder logic conventions in motor control. I'm actively seeking common practices, particularly concerning seal-in contacts and how overload sensors are typically incorporated for effective fault handling. I'm hoping to quickly identify established norms in this area.

Constructing the Motor Logic

I've got the basics down for a simple motor control circuit's ladder logic. Inputs and outputs are clear: Start (NO), Stop (NC), Overload (NC), Motor Contactor, and Run Indicator Light. I'm focusing on the seal-in circuit, with the Start button paralleled by the Motor Contactor contact.

Refining the Logic Schema

I'm now clarifying the logic representation. I've chosen IEC 61131-3 symbols (XIC, XIO, OTE) and I'm ensuring all stop conditions are in series for safety. I'm focusing on the ASCII diagrams and JSON format for representing the rungs. I'm prioritizing data flow and error handling. I've considered that a Normally Closed button, like the stop button, actually means the power flow is TRUE when it is not pressed (high).
