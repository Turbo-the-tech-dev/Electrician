        <h1>Electrician</h1>
        <p><em>A mobile app for electricians featuring essential electrical calculators.</em></p>

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            The Electrician app is a practical mobile application built with React Native + Expo, designed to assist electricians with essential calculations. It provides tools for common electrical laws, making complex calculations quick and accessible on the go.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>**Ohm's Law Calculator:** Calculates Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Power based on any two inputs.</li>
            <li>**Ampere's Law Calculator:** Provides calculations for straight wires, solenoids, and toroids.</li>
            <li>Input validation and error handling for all calculators.</li>
            <li>User-friendly interface suitable for both Android and iOS devices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Future of Electrician</h2>
        <p>The vision for the Electrician app is to become a comprehensive toolkit for electrical professionals. Future enhancements include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Resistor Color Code Calculator:** A tool to determine resistance values from color bands.</li>
            <li>**Voltage Divider Calculator:** For analyzing voltage divider circuits.</li>
            <li>**Capacitance and Inductance Calculators:** Expanding the range of electrical concepts covered.</li>
            <li>UI/UX improvements for a more polished and intuitive experience, including dark mode.</li>
            <li>Robust unit and end-to-end testing to ensure reliability and maintainability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The project's progress and direction will be tracked through the issues in this repository.</p>
