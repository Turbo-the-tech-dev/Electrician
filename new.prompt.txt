  │     4 You are a senior curriculum developer tasked with         │
  │       creating a comprehensive training program for a           │
  │       specialized technical field. Drawing from the successful  │
  │       development of the "Professional Electrical Installation  │
  │       and Maintenance Training Manual," you will now create a   │
  │       similar program for a different technical discipline.     │    │     5                                                           │
