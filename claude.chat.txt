This curriculum design establishes a rigorous, safety-focused training program for Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). This discipline is the logical progression from general electrical installation, bridging the gap between standard wiring and the intelligent systems that drive modern manufacturing.

2. Detailed Content Outline: Sample Chapter (Module 05)
To demonstrate the pedagogical rigor, here is the breakdown for Module 05: PLC Hardware & Architecture.
A. Theory Component (4 Hours)
 * The Scan Cycle: Input Scan \rightarrow Program Execution \rightarrow Output Scan.
 * I/O Types: Difference between Discrete (24VDC/120VAC) and Analog (Voltage/Current).
 * Sinking vs. Sourcing: The physics of current flow in input cards.
 * Safety Callout: Never force inputs/outputs on running machinery without visual verification.
B. Lab Component (4 Hours)
 * Activity 5.1: Hardware Assembly. Student mounts power supply, CPU, and I/O cards to DIN rail.
 * Activity 5.2: Wiring "The Common Mistake." Student intentionally wires a sinking sensor to a sinking card (on a mock bench) to observe failure, then corrects it to sourcing.
 * Activity 5.3: The "Smoke Test" Protocol. Step-by-step power-up procedure to verify voltage levels before engaging the CPU.
C. Assessment
 * Quiz: 10 questions (e.g., "Calculate the current draw for a rack of 4 modules").
 * Skill Sign-off: Instructor verifies the student can replace a fused output card in under 5 minutes while maintaining safety protocols.
3. Supporting Documentation Strategy
The "Back-Pocket" Field Reference Guide
A durable, 4x6 inch laminated booklet designed for field use.
> Included References:
>  * Resistor color codes and standard fuse ratings.
>  * NEMA vs. IEC starter size chart.
>  * RJ45 pinout (T568B).
>  * Quick-lookup table for 4-20mA to Hex/Decimal conversion.
>  * 7 Steps of Troubleshooting (Standardized).
> 
Instructor Guide
 * Answer Keys: Annotated logic diagrams showing why a specific rung is correct.
 * Lab Setup: "Recipe cards" for Lab Technicians to prep benches (e.g., "Station 4 needs a faulty proximity switch installed for Troubleshooting Drill").
 * Rubrics: Specific deductions for safety violations (e.g., "Automatic Fail for working on live voltage without specific instructor authorization").
4. Assessment Strategy
Comprehensive Final Exam (Capstone)
 * Format: 50 Questions + 1 Practical Challenge.
 * Question Mix:
   * 30% Theory (Physics/Logic).
   * 30% Code & Safety (NEC/NFPA).
   * 40% Scenario-based (Troubleshooting).
 * The Practical Challenge: "The Black Box."
   * Students are given a system with 3 introduced faults (software bug, blown fuse, broken wire).
   * Goal: Return system to full operation in < 45 minutes.
Quality Assurance Checklist
 * Are all circuit diagrams compliant with current IEEE/ANSI symbols?
 * Do all HMI screenshots have Alt-Text for accessibility?
 * Are safety warnings (DANGER, WARNING, CAUTION) color-coded to ANSI Z535 standards?
5. Resource Planning & Master Procurement
Master Procurement Spreadsheet (Snapshot)
 * Capital Equipment:
   * 10x Training Stations (PLC + HMI + VFD combo).
   * 10x 3-Phase Induction Motors (1/3 HP).
 * Consumables:
   * Wire (14AWG THHN, Red/Black/Blue/White).
   * Ferrule crimps and terminal blocks.
 * Video Resources:
   * Selected clips from manufacturer channels (Siemens/Allen-Bradley/Schneider) regarding device installation.
   * Internal "Safety Fail" compilation (dramatizations of what goes wrong when safety is ignored).
Implementation Timeline
 * Weeks 1-4: Content drafting and reviewing theory.
 * Weeks 5-8: Lab equipment procurement and bench fabrication.
 * Weeks 9-10: "Alpha" test—instructors run the labs to identify snags.
 * Week 12: Final print run of manuals and full launch.
